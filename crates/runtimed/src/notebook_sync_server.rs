//! Room-based notebook synchronization server.
//!
//! Each open notebook gets a "room" in the daemon. Multiple windows editing
//! the same notebook sync through the room's canonical Automerge document.
//!
//! Follows the same sync protocol pattern as `sync_server.rs` (settings sync)
//! but with per-notebook state.

// Implementation coming in next commit.
