//! Client for the notebook sync service.
//!
//! Each notebook window creates a `NotebookSyncClient` that maintains a local
//! Automerge document replica of the notebook. Changes made locally are sent
//! to the daemon, and changes from other peers arrive as sync messages.

// Implementation coming in next commit.
