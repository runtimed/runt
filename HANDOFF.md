# Unified Output System - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: Implementation complete and production ready.

## Summary

Successfully replaced single `cellOutputAdded` event with granular, type-safe events providing better performance and streaming capabilities.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Granular events: `multimediaDisplayOutputAdded`, `terminalOutputAdded`, `markdownOutputAdded`, etc.
- ✅ Type-safe MediaRepresentation schema supporting both inline and artifact content
- ✅ Streaming append operations for real-time output (`terminalOutputAppended`, `markdownOutputAppended`)
- ✅ Enhanced clear_output(wait=True/False) support with pending clear logic
- ✅ All 58 tests passing across runtime and client
- ✅ Full client integration with proper output rendering

### MediaRepresentation Schema

The new schema supports both inline data and future artifact references:

```typescript
MediaRepresentation = {
  type: "inline", data: any, metadata?: any
} | {
  type: "artifact", artifactId: string, metadata?: any
}
```

### Next Steps

The unified output system provides the foundation for the planned artifact service, enabling large outputs to be stored externally while maintaining the same MediaRepresentation interface.
