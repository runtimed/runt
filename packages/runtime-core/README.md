# @runt/runtime-core

Shared runtime core functionality for runt agents.

**Current Status**: Placeholder package. Shared runtime functionality will be extracted from `@runt/lib` in future iterations.

## Planned Features

This package will provide common runtime functionality used across different runt agents:

- Runtime lifecycle management interfaces
- Common execution abstractions
- Shared utilities for runtime agents
- Core types and contracts

## Usage

```typescript
import { /* TBD */ } from "jsr:@runt/runtime-core";
```

## Development

This package is part of the runt monorepo build pipeline but contains placeholder exports until functionality is extracted from `@runt/lib`.

See the main [runt repository](https://github.com/runtimed/anode) for development setup and contribution guidelines.
